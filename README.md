# final-project
My final project will be the website for an in-development video game, the landing page will consist of the typical information you’d expect like ‘about us’, ‘contact’ etc, a nav menu for navigating to the other (simple) pages that form the website, an interactive gallery and (possible) imbedded twitter/insta feed or blog style news section for developer updates/news. I plan to approach this with mobile first in mind with responsive design to allow effective viewing on various devices. Given time I’d like to include a few features like a signup form, a simple storefront for buying in game items and an account login page, these won’t be entirely functional (no back end, apis etc, just some  JS i've prototyped based on the shopping list app and other projects) and just for show, but they can demonstrate some further ideas we have explored during class and allow me to showcase some different style techniques that we have learnt.
